# DeviceKMC
KMC simulator for VCM RRAM. Models the time evolution of conductive filaments in atomically-resolved filamentary RRAM devices under varying potential and thermal gradients. Currently set up to model a TiN-HfO2/Ti-TiN stack. 

NOTE: Until April 22nd, LUMI is down for an ongoing maintenance break (see https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/lumi-service-status/lumi-cooling-distribution-unit-flush-3-21-4-2024-and-lustre-maintenance-break-15-21-4-2024/). This repository is a temporary snapshot of the last code folder we accessed, but will be updated on the 22nd with the module and compile environments used.
